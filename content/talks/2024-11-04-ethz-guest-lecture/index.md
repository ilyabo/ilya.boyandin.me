# Geographic data visualization with deck.gl

<button  variant=outline href="https://youtu.be/G58beQZlMxg">Slides Video</button>


I gave a guest lecture at the [ETH ZÃ¼rich Institute of Cartography](https://ikg.ethz.ch/en/) by invitation from [Andreas Neumann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-neumann-a10114277/).  In the lecture I discussed geo data visualization using [deck.gl](https://deck.gl), [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl) and [Foursquare Studio](/p/fsq-studio). I also covered using the AI code editor, [Cursor](https://cursor.com), to assist in coding, as well as [spatial indexing with H3](https://h3geo.org/) and efficient data processing with [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org). The second half of the talk focused on flow map visualization and the tools I've developed for it: [flowmap.gl](/p/flowmap.gl), [flowmap.blue](/p/flowmap.blue) and [flowmap.city](/p/flowmap-city). 

There is no talk recording, but I exported a video from the Keynote presentation, which includes many high quality screen recordings:
