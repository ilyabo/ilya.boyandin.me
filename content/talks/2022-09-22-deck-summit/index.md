["Dynamically adaptive Deck.gl layer
for mobility data in FlowmapBlue"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MqGaL5rzBoCmV-xjuwlCfOupZ3anqNp0Lh6ckjh14FM/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) presented at the [Open Visualization Collaborator Summit](https://deck.gl/events/madrid-summit-2022/) in Madrid.

Talk abstract:
> FlowmapBlue is a free tool for rendering origin-destination data (counts of movements between pairs of locations). Geographic networks often contain large numbers of connections and displaying them on a map presents significant challenges both in terms of the rendering performance and the map readability. To address these challenges in FlowmapBlue we decided to not always show the data in full detail, but instead to present useful and readable summaries which constantly adapt to the map viewport. In this talk, we'll discuss the motivation behind this approach and describe the inner workings of the FlowmapLayer implementation in FlowmapBlue.
