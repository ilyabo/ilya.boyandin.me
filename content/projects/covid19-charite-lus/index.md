This was a project I volunteered to help with to help medical researchers during the outbreak of COVID-19.
I built a simple video annotation tool used for a medical study
carried out at [Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin](https://nephrologie-intensivmedizin.charite.de/).

The full title: [“Point-of-care lung ultrasound in COVID-19 patients: inter- and intra-observer agreement in a prospective observational study”](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90153-2).
The results of the study were published in [Nature - Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90153-2).

Testimonial from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/frederic-muench-md-72b56042/">Frederic Muench, MD,
Resident Physician, Nephrology & Intensive Care at Charité</a>:

<blockquote>
We collaborated with Ilya in a COVID-19 intensive care unit project at the university hospital Charité Berlin and were thrilled by his work. Within a week after kick-off we had a working and stable online tool which incorporated more functionalities than expected and its usability and design (which was crucial to the project) was just great! Ilya had additionally optimised our initial idea which in the end resulted in a much more broadly usable tool. He also agreed to modify the tool for a follow-up study. The results of the projects are currently in review and will be published for the medical community soon. This would not have been possible without Ilya's commitment and effectiveness. We definitely endorse Ilya and his work, and really hope to further collaborate!
