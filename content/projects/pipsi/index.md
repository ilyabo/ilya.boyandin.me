One evening my 8 year old asked me to make a game with her plush guinea pig. Few hours later, this is what we came up with.
It is not just about reacting quickly. To succeed you need to plan ahead to minimize the distance traveled.

I made an original [music track](https://soundcloud.com/ibananti/control-seq) for the game.
