[Foursquare Spatial Desktop](https://foursquare.com/products/spatial-desktop) - a powerful geospatial analysis tool and modernized version of [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl) running natively on your desktop with an embedded [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) as the spatial processing engine.

The big win? Everything happens locally. Your data stays on your machine â€“ you're not limited by network bandwidth or shared cloud resources, you can fully utilize your desktop computer and can save projects as local files.

And... The app is built on [SQLRooms](/p/sqlrooms) - our open-source framework for creating data analysis environments.
