An interactive map showing incidents that have resulted in potential civilian impact or harm since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The incidents have been collected by [Bellingcat researchers](https://ukraine.bellingcat.com/). Included in the map are instances where civilian areas and infrastructure have been damaged or destroyed, where the presence of civilian injuries are visible and/or there is the presence of immobile civilian bodies.
