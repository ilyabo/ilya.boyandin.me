Network analysis tools can be intimidating, and especially, the data preparation in the form that these tools expect (which often involves combining multiple datasets) can be very time-consuming. SQL is a very powerful and quite popuar language for data analysis and manipulation which can be of immense help for the data preparation. However, setting up a database with an SQL query engine is often a tedious process.
