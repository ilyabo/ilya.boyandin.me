[SQLRooms](https://sqlrooms.org/) is an open-source library that provides a foundation and set of building blocks for creating data analytics applications that run entirely in the browser. It combines essential components like a SQL query engine (DuckDB), data visualization tools, state management, and UI components into a cohesive toolkit, making it significantly easier to create powerful analytics tools without a backend.
