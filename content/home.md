👋 Hi there,

<img width="922" height="922" float="right" src="me-userpic.jpg" mt="0" mb="10">

I am Ilya. I am a software engineer. I design and develop geographic data visualizations and
geo data analytics tools.

I've completed <a href="/">many projects</a> for media, private companies, NGOs, transportation authorities
and academic institutions.
I've worked at big IT companies and startups, universities
and a <a href="http://interactivethings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renowned design studio</a>.
Currently, I am helping to build the
<a href="http://studio.foursquare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next generation geospatial analytics platform</a>
at <a href="https://unfolded.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unfolded</a>/<a href="https://location.foursquare.com/products/studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foursquare</a>.
In late 2020 I founded <a href="https://www.geovisually.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeoVisually GmbH</a>,
an interactive maps and geographic data visualization consultancy.

My special interest is in visualizing data about
geographic movement of people or goods, e.g. transport-related data.
I wrote <a href="/assets/thesis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my thesis</a> about this topic
and developed <a href="https://flowmap.blue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FlowmapBlue</a>, a
free online tool for visualizing origin-destination movement.
I am passionate about building tools which help cities to shift to sustainable mobility.

Check out <a href="/resume/">my full resume</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyabo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my LinkedIn page</a> for more details on my professional background.

I live in Switzerland. I like being in the ⛰ nature and 🚴🏻‍♂️ cycling. I am the father of 👦🏻🧒🏼.
I play guitar and 🎹 and [make electronic music](/music).
I share [much of my code online](https://github.com/ilyabo).
